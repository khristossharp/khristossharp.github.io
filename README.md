## Tennis Game

The tennis game is built using C#, ASP.NET Core, HTML/CSS, and MudBlazor components. The game consists of the user playing against the computer. Here's how it works:

- **Serve**: The user selects a side to serve. If the computer guesses correctly, it gets a point. If not, the user wins the point.
- **Gameplay**: After the serve, the ball moves to the computer's side, and the player must guess where the ball will go to continue the game.
